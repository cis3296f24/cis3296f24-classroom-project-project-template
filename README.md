# Spaceify

## Project Abstract

Spaceify is inspired by web applications like Reciptify, Instafest, and Icebergify that reimagine new ways to visualize Spotify's listening data. Spaceify allows users to display their top tracks from the past month, six months, and all time in a unique and engaging way. Users can visually explore their listening history in an aesthetic and fun manner, as well as share it with friends.

## Conceptual Design

The application features an interactive, space-themed scatter plot that visualizes a Spotify userâ€™s top tracks over different durations. It is designed to run on any machine with moderate specs, with Linux systems being ideal for development. However, it is also compatible with Windows and macOS. The application will be built using Node.js and will involve several programming languages throughout the development process, including:

- **HTML & CSS** for the user interface
- **JavaScript** for interactivity
- **Python** (possibly with Flask) for backend services and user authentication
- **React** for building a responsive user interface
- **D3.js** or **Plotly** for data visualization

The project will utilize the Spotify Web API to fetch data regarding user listening habits.

## How to Run

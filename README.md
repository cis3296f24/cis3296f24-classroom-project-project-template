# ChessGDK

ChessGDK is a 2D Chess Game application developed in Java, featuring an interactive user interface and an AI-powered opponent. Designed for simplicity, flexibility, and cross-platform compatibility, this project is easily extendable with new features. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/), creating a visually appealing and responsive chessboard for player interaction. Core game logic, including piece movement, turn-based play, and move validation, is encapsulated in a dedicated logic layer for clean separation of concerns.

This project was initialized as a [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project using [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

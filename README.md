# Project Name
Flappy Bird is a simple arcade-style game that was created for the mobile phone. This project is a chance to bring the game back onto the computer screen and add in our changes. The objective of the game is quite simple, you control the bird's flying for it to dodge an endless amount of pipes, and every time you avoid one you receive a point. Once you fail to avoid the pipe and the bird collides it records your score up until that point, the user's main goal is to receive the highest number of points. Further changes can include power-ups, different difficulties, and different sprites to fit a theme.

Adding a screenshot or a mockup of your application in action would be nice.
